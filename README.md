# LIMOncello

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19567)


Another tightly coupled LiDAR‑Inertial SLAM algorithm? Yep, based on the existing algorithms
[FAST-LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO), [LIMO-Velo](https://github.com/Huguet57/LIMO-Velo),
[Fast LIMO](https://github.com/fetty31/fast_LIMO) and
[DLIO](https://github.com/vectr-ucla/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry), but cleaner, faster, and
without [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM)/[ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree)
dependencies.

LIMOncello is essentially FAST-LIO 2 with the Fast LIMO (and thus DLIO) implementation, but
without any dependency on the [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM) or
[ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) C++ libraries. It implements an Iterated Error
State Extended Kalman Filter (IESKF) as described in IKFoM and FAST-LIO 2, reimplemented using
the [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif) library and a refactored version of the original
[iOctree](https://github.com/zhujun3753/i-octree) data structure.

This is the result of my efforts to truly understand LIMO‑Velo and, consequently, FAST-LIO 2.
Those insights led to an improvement in performance and accuracy: LIMOncello is the first known
LIO‑SLAM system to incorporate the SGal(3) manifold in its state representation, and it uses
iOctree, which is much faster and more efficient than iKd-Tree. On top of that, the code is
portable, not as Fast LIMO, but as simplified as possible (the entire IKFoM library is
synthesized into `State.hpp` thanks to [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif), for example)
so it’s accessible to anyone who wants to modify it.

## Dependencies

LIMOncello is header-only and the core depends only on:
- [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [oneTBB](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB)
- [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif)

All Livox driver dependencies can be bypassed by compiling  
[RESPLE](https://github.com/ASIG-X/RESPLE) or by solely using its custom message  
definitions.

## Approach

To truly understand the concepts, here are the papers that greatly influenced this work, apart
from Fast LIMO:
- [IKFoM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03804)
- [FAST-LIO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08196) and [FAST-LIO2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06829)
- [Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02508)
- [A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537)
- [Absolute humanoid localization and mapping based on IMU Lie group and fiducial markers](https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/206456)
- [iOctree](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08315)


I should also mention [S-FAST_LIO](https://github.com/zlwang7/S-FAST_LIO), which helped me grasp
the initial intuition behind the math of IKFoM, and [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif),
which provides accessible, elegant Lie algebra tools for nearly any manifold used in robotics.


## How To

Run the node by specifying the configuration name (without the `.yaml` extension):

```shell
ros2 launch limoncello limoncello.launch.py config_name:=cat16x
```

The launch file loads the configuration from `<limoncello_package>/config/<config_name>.yaml`.
Optional launch arguments:

```shell
ros2 launch limoncello limoncello.launch.py config_name:=cat16x rviz:=true use_sim_time:=false
```

Most parameters are documented directly in each configuration file. However,
special attention should be paid to those related to `sensors.calibration`,
`sensors.time_offset`, `sensors.extrinsics`, and `sensors.intrinsics`.

First, note that the IMU reference frame is used as the robot reference frame in
the Kalman filter. The IMU frame and LiDAR frame are both defined with respect
to the `base_link`, which is an arbitrarily chosen reference location on the robot.
For example, in wheeled vehicles this is often the projection of the center of
gravity (CoG) onto the x–y plane, such that the LiDAR map places the floor on
the x–y plane.

Under this convention, `sensors.extrinsics.imu2baselink` defines the initial pose
(position and orientation) of the system at startup, meaning `base_link` coincides
with the world origin at that moment. For instance, most IMUs follow the NEU convention, 
but they are often rotated 180 degrees about the x-axis, resulting in the z-axis pointing 
downward. In such case, that must be accounted for in `sensors.extrinsics.imu2baselink`.

`sensors.intrinsics` may be manually specified and are typically obtained from a
static IMU calibration procedure, during which Allan noise parameters are also
estimated—Allan noise parameters are used to configure `IKFoM.covariance`.
If the IMU has not been calibrated, it is recommended to assign reasonably large
values (but not exceeding 1) to `IKFoM.covariance`, and smaller
values to `sensors.intrinsics`.

If poor initialization is observed, it is most likely due to incorrect initial bias
estimation. In such cases, you may reduce the initial covariance value
`IKFoM.covariance.initial_cov` to help stabilize the filter startup (this should be
done cautiously), or calibrate the bias online using `sensors.calibration`,
assuming the robot is stationary. When enabled, `sensors.calibration.gravity_align`
attempts to refine the initial orientation defined in `sensors.extrinsics.imu2baselink`.
Gravity alignment exploits the fact that gravity always points downward by detecting
discrepancies between the expected gravity direction and the accelerometer
measurements during static conditions.

Although the LiDAR and IMU may be physically misaligned,
`sensors.calibration.gravity_align` applies the same rotation and translation
correction to both sensors, assuming they are rigidly mounted to the same body.
The relative extrinsics between the IMU and the LiDAR therefore remain fixed and
are not re-estimated. As a result, the IMU (and thus the robot body frame) may not
appear level with respect to the ground.

It is strongly discouraged to enable `IKFoM.estimate_extrinsics`. In most practical
scenarios, online extrinsic estimation does not converge reliably and often leads to
unstable or incorrect behavior. Providing accurate extrinsic parameters offline is
the recommended approach.

`sensors.time_offset` does not need to be set when the LiDAR and IMU are not
hardware synchronized. As long as both sensors timestamp messages using the same
UTC time base, LIMOncello will handle the alignment internally. This parameter is
primarily intended for situations where the sensors are not properly synchronized at
the software level.

Finally, note that the estimated velocity is published with respect to `base_link`,
not the IMU frame. This frame convention can be modified in
`include/ROSUtils.hpp` if needed.
